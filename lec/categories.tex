\chapter*{Preface}

\marginnote{This preface is written by Steven.}
This is a course on category theory for programming languages researchers.  I
would say that this book, and this course, are developed in anger: I have been
forced to learn and understand a bit about category theory due to its inevitable
usefulness. 
I would not describe myself as a category theorist, and this class is quite 
unlike any I've ever tried to teach before.
My goal in this class is to tease out what I find inevitable 
about category theory, and present it in the way that makes the most sense to 
me. Of course, this isn't possible without John, who is the one who 
really understands everything here.

Many programming languages researchers and students have encountered category
theory at one point or another. Probably most see it for the first time when
they are learning Haskell, when they see words like ``monad'' and ``functor.''
Perhaps others who are more mathematically inclined see it when they are
learning about the lambda calculus and hear about Scott, Smyth, and Plotkin's
famous developments of the model theory of the untyped lambda
calculus~\citep{smyth1982category}. You're here because you probably saw 
category theory somewhere and wondered why it was needed, or perhaps 
were skeptical that it was really necessary.

For me, the first time I saw category theory appear in my own research that 
forced me to stop and understand it was Heunen et al.'s quasi-Borel spaces paper.~\cite{heunen2017convenient} This was 
during my second year of grad school, and I have to admit I found it 
extremely intimidating. This paper was a terrifying combination of (1) seeming 
very important to my immediate research, and (2) being utterly and completely incomprehensible.
In a nutshell, this paper introduced a denotational semantics for a higher-order 
probabilistic programming language with continuous probability distributions called \emph{quasi-Borel spaces} (QBS).
I was -- and still am! -- a probabilistic programming languages researcher, so this result seemed pivotal: 
I like functions!
However, at the time, it wasn't even obvious to me \emph{why this was a hard thing to do
in the first place!} If you can't understand the motivation for a problem, 
good luck understanding its solution. 

The core challenge, helpfully provided in the second paragraph 
of the paper, is:

\begin{quotation}
  ``Programs in these languages may combine higher-order functions and
  continuous distributions, or even define a probability distribution on
  functions. But the standard measure theoretic formalization of probability
  theory does not handle
higher-order functions well, as the category of measurable
spaces is not cartesian closed.''~\citep{heunen2017convenient}
\end{quotation}

This made \emph{absolutely no sense to me}. The only citation is to a paper from 1961, called
``Borel structures for function spaces''~\citep{aumann1961borel}, which was
equally (if not even more!) incomprehensible than the current paper I was trying
to understand. I was out of my depth and had to move on, and I did not 
understand this paper for many years.

At the time the QBS paper seemed like it came like a bolt from the blue and
really shook my confidence in my own ability to do research, but over the past 8
years I've come to realize that, in some sense, this seemingly tour-de-force
alien paper was an almost inevitable combination of simple ideas.  It turns out
that the idea for quasi-Borel spaces was born not in probability but in a
seemingly totally disparate corner of mathematics: differential geometry and
topology. Last year I was having a conversation with Max New about QBS, who told me that the setup
had occurred to him in grad school, but he wasn't motivated to fully develop it due to its 
seemingly straightforward relationship to diffeological spaces: 
these results are so similar, structurally, that to a trained expert the monstrous
QBS paper almost seems \emph{too trivial!}
This is our first answer to the question of \emph{why category theory?} -- it makes precise the analogies 
that exist between disparate areas of mathematics, allowing you to solve different 
problems using very similar machinery.

If this was the only time I encountered category theory I would not have
become invested enough in it to attempt to teach a course on it. But, 
it continues to appear. My subsequent encounters with category 
theory were driven primarily by my PhD. student John, who is helping me 
teach this class and write this book. This story begins with Lilac~\citep{li2023lilac}, 
a probabilistic separation logic that we developed during the first two 
years of John's PhD. Before we get into that we need to briefly discuss 
separation logics -- I promise we'll get to category theory.

Separation logics are logics that describe resources. They are widely 
used within programming languages to model how resources like memory
flow around programs. Concretely, consider the following C program:

\begin{lstlisting}[mathescape=true]
void foo(int* x, int* y) {
  for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    *x += *y;
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

One might look at \texttt{foo} and assume that it is very inefficiently written:
it could be optimized to simply add \texttt{3*y} to \texttt{x}.  But, \emph{what
if \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} point to the same location in memory} (i.e., they
are aliases)? Then, this optimization is no longer valid, since
\texttt{y} is also mutating on each iteration of the loop. Since the C compiler 
must be pessimistic, it cannot perform this optimization.

Separation logics give us a language for describing memory ownership so that 
we can tell the compiler that these pointers do not alias. If we 
want this optimization to be valid, then  \texttt{foo} must have a
\emph{precondition} that asserts that the two arguments 
must not be aliases of each other. In separation logic, this precondition 
can be written as:
\begin{align*}
  [\texttt{x} \mapsto -] * [\texttt{y} \mapsto -]
\end{align*}

The $*$ is called the \emph{separating conjunction}: it states that the two
propositions $[\texttt{x} \mapsto -]$ (read ``\texttt{x} points to some 
location'') and $[\texttt{y} \mapsto -]$ hold of \emph{disjoint} portions of the
heap, and hence \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} cannot be aliases of one another.

However, memory is not the only kind of resource in a program: \emph{randomness}
is also a natural kind of resource. In probabilistic programs, we might like to 
express propositions like:
\begin{align*}
  [x \sim \texttt{Bern}~1/2] * [y \sim \texttt{Bern}~1/2]
\end{align*}
This would express that two variables $x$ and $y$ are \emph{independent}
Bernoulli random variables.
Beyond probability, it's clear that programs might have many other notions of
resources, like network sockets, mutex locks, etc. Must we develop
\emph{from-scratch} separation logics for each of them?

This leads us to the second answer to the \emph{why category theory?}
question: it makes certain choices that seem ad-hoc \emph{forced}.  We will see
how there is a categorical description of the separating
conjunction that can be \emph{calculated} using something called the ``Day
convolution''~\citep{dongol2016convolution,biering2007bi}.
If your 
interpretation of $*$ arises from this construction, then you get \emph{for free}
that it satisfies many other well-formedness requirements for separating conjunction.\marginnote{We 
are foreshadowing here, but we will return the Day convolution later on 
in the course once we've worked up to it.}
This shows how category 
theory can bring clarity to this 
proliferation of interactions by highlighting which decisions you've made 
are actually \emph{new} and which are \emph{consequences}: it forces your hand,
which is very useful when you don't know where your hand is supposed to go.

At this point, I'm convinced some familiarity with category theory 
is a worthwhile investment for anyone doing research in programming 
languages, especially those working with exotic effects like 
probability or those working with program logics. I also have some hubris: 
I believe that it is not so hard to understand, especially if one 
is sufficiently motivated by some of the applications that we will 
attempt to highlight as we go.
My target audience for this class is past me from 2017 seeing an important 
paper in their area that feels terribly out of reach because of its 
fluent application of categorical ideas. I hope that we can 
present some of these ideas clearly enough for you to see the inevitability, 
rather than be drowned by the unintelligability, of these elegant ideas.

\chapter{Semantics of Programs} \label{sec:semantics-of-programs}

One of the most common places one encounters category theory is in semantics. To
illustrate why categories appear here and what they are typically used for,
we'll consider a concrete example that every programmer has encountered: 
we want to establish which operations change the behavior of our programs
and which are irrelevant.

Let's start by examining a simple programming language, a tiny language 
with let-bindings, pairs, and the unit value:
\begin{gather}
  \begin{aligned}
  M,N &::= \pllet{x}{M}{N} \mid x \mid \plunit{} \mid \plpair{M}{N} \mid \plfst{M} \mid \plsnd{M} \\
  A,B &::= A \times B \mid \plUnit
  \end{aligned}
  \tag{\textsc{Calc}}
  \label{lang:calc}
\end{gather}

\ref{lang:calc} has  a very simple type system that ensures well-formedness of programs.
The \emph{typing context} $\Gamma$ is a set of variables; we denote the empty context as $\ctxemp$. The relation $\Gamma \vdash M : A$
says that ``the term $M$ is well-typed using context $\Gamma$''. We can then define 
this relation inductively on terms:
\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule{~}{\Gamma \vdash \plunit : \plUnit}
  \qquad
  \inferrule{\Gamma \vdash M : A \and \Gamma \vdash N : B}
  {\Gamma \vdash \plpair{M}{N} : A \times B}
  \\
  \inferrule{x : A \in \Gamma}{\Gamma \vdash x : A}
  \qquad
  \inferrule{\Gamma \vdash M : A \times B}
  {\Gamma \vdash \plfst{M} : A}
  \qquad
  \inferrule{\Gamma \vdash M : A \times B}
  {\Gamma \vdash \plsnd{M} : B}
  \\
  \inferrule{\Gamma \vdash M : A \and \Gamma, x : A \vdash N : B}
  {\Gamma \vdash \pllet{x}{M}{N} : B}
\end{mathpar}


Now consider the following example \textsc{Calc} program, which is well-typed in 
some context $\Gamma$:
\begin{align}
  \pllet{x}{M}{\Big( \pllet{y}{N}{\plpair{x}{y}} \Big)}
\end{align}

If we assume that $N$ does not refer to $x$, then we ought to 
be able to reorder the let-bindings without changing the meaning of 
the program, like so:

\begin{align}
  \pllet{y}{N}{\Big( \pllet{x}{M}{\plpair{x}{y}} \Big)}
\end{align}

Now, how can we prove this reordering is valid? We need to give a 
formal semantics to \textsc{Calc} programs, and prove that the 
semantics of these two programs is the same.

\section{A Denotational Semantics for \textsc{Calc}} \label{sec:calc-in-finset}
The first step in designing a semantics is to choose a \textbf{metalanguage} for
stating these semantics.  The metalanguage should be a formal language that
unambiguous to describe and use, because its meaning will be taken for granted
when we interpret programs using it.  A natural choice of metalanguage is the
language of sets and functions between sets.

Using this metalanguage we can give a \textbf{denotational semantics} to
\textsc{Calc} programs that describes the meaning of syntactic programs using 
our choice of metalanguage.
We use the \textbf{semantic bracket} $\dbracket{-}$ to define these semantics.

To give a semantics of \textsc{Calc} programs, it is first useful to give a
semantics of types and contexts.  Types will be interpreted as sets:
\begin{align} \label{eqn:calc-types-in-finset}
  \dbracket{\plUnit} &= \{\star\} \\
  \dbracket{\plpair{A}{B}} &= \dbracket{A} \times \dbracket{B}
\end{align}

The symbol $\{\star\}$ is the set containing a single element. The symbol
$\dbracket{A} \times \dbracket{B}$ denotes the Cartesian product of two sets.
Notice that the semantics types is described \emph{compositionally}: the 
semantics of the type $\plpair{A}{B}$ is given by the meaning of its subterms.

Next, we can give a semantic interpretation of contexts. The semantics of 
contexts is also a set, which is defined inductively 
again using Cartesian products:
\begin{align*}
  \dbracket{\ctxemp} = \{\star\},
  \qquad\qquad
  \dbracket{\Gamma, x : A} =  \dbracket{\Gamma} \times \dbracket{A}
\end{align*}

Now we can give a semantics of \textsc{Calc} terms as functions between sets. 
The semantics of terms has the form $\dbracket{\Gamma \vdash M : A}
: \dbracket{\Gamma} \to \dbracket{A}$.
We can define these semantics as follows:
\marginnote{Unpacking notation: the ``$\gamma \mapsto v$'' symbol defines a set function that 
associates a substitution $\gamma$ of type $\dbracket{\Gamma}$ with value $v$. The
pair former $(-,-)$ forms a set pair, and the projects $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ 
are the set-functions that project out the first and second component respectively.}
\begin{align*}
  \dbracket{\plunit{}} &= \gamma \mapsto \star\\
  \dbracket{\plpair{M}{N}} &= \gamma \mapsto (\dbracket{M}~\gamma, \dbracket{N}~\gamma) \\
  \dbracket{\plfst{M}} &= \gamma \mapsto \pi_1 (\dbracket{M}~\gamma) \\
  \dbracket{\plsnd{M}} &= \gamma \mapsto \pi_2 (\dbracket{M}~\gamma) \\
  \dbracket{x} &= \gamma \mapsto \pi_x (\gamma) \\
  \dbracket{\pllet{x}{M}{N}} &= \gamma \mapsto \dbracket{N}~\gamma[x \mapsto \dbracket{M}~\gamma]
\end{align*}

Now we can use these semantics to validate our reorderings from earlier:
\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{align*}
  \dbracket{\pllet{x}{M}{\Big( \pllet{y}{N}{\plpair{x}{y}} \Big)}}
  = \gamma \mapsto (\dbracket{M}~\gamma, \dbracket{N}~\gamma)
  = \dbracket{\pllet{y}{N}{\Big( \pllet{x}{M}{\plpair{x}{y}} \Big)}}
\end{align*}
\end{fullwidth}

But, notice that there are subtleties! We are relying on our metalanguage's
notion of equality of functions here to determine equality. Two functions $f,g :
A \to B$ are considered equal if they are \emph{extensionally equal}, meaning
that for all $a \in A$, it is the case that $f(a) = g(a)$. 
If we carefully unpacked these two semantics, we would see that the functions 
$\dbracket{M}$ and $\dbracket{N}$ are composed in different orders. 
Under the semantics of sets, this order of composition does not matter since 
it does not change the input--output behavior.

\section{The Need for Generality}
To sum up what just happened: in order to prove a natural program equivalence 
involving reorder of let-bindings, we gave a denotational semantics to \ref{lang:calc} in terms
of sets and functions. Then, a property of the metalanguage -- extensional
equality of functions -- directly implied that the rewriting was
semantics-preserving.\footnote{This idea of using denotational semantics to 
capture program equivalences originates with Plotkin~\citep{plotkin1977lcf} and
the notion of full abstraction. We are intentionally eliding these details here,
since they involve defining observational equivalence.} 

This style of denotational reasoning worked quite well for validating program
equivalences, which begs the question: \emph{how well does it generalize} to
other kinds of programming languages and analyses?  There are several
interesting dimensions along which we may want to generalize this kind of
argument:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item To languages with more interesting kinds of effects, such as allocation
  of randomness, nondeterminism, or memory; 
  \item To languages with more interesting features, such as higher-order
  functions or more interesting type systems;
  \item To settings where we desire more exotic notions of program equivalences;
  \item To analyses other than program reordering, such as abstract interpretation 
  and logical relations.
\end{enumerate}

We will see that it is actually quite inconvenient to use sets and functions as a metalangauge, 
which will be a central motivation our development of category theory as an alternative 
and more flexible metalangauge for giving semantics to programs (and other things, like 
program logics).
But before we can see this,
we will first need to see an example of each of these kinds of generalization.

\section{Generalization 1: Probabilistic Effects}
Let's see an example of generalizing to languages with an interesting probabilistic 
effect. Consider the following little \emph{probabilistic programming language} called
\textsc{TinyPPL}:
\begin{gather}
  \begin{aligned}
  M,N ::=& \pllet{x}{M}{N} \mid x \mid \plpair{M}{N} \mid \plfst{M} \mid \plsnd{M} \\
   & \plflip{} \mid \pltrue{} \mid \plfalse{}  \\
  A,B ::=& A \times B \mid \plBool
  \end{aligned}
  \tag{\textsc{TinyPPL}}
  \label{lang:tinyppl}
\end{gather}

Probabilistic programming languages denote probability distributions. For instance,
here is the denotation of $\plflip{}$:
\begin{align*}
  \dbracket{\plflip{}} = v \mapsto 
  \begin{cases}
    1/2 \quad& \text{if }v=\pltrue\\
    1/2 \quad& \text{if }v=\plfalse\\
    0 \quad& \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
We are again interested in proving natural equivalences such as the one 
we saw earlier where let-bindings can be reordered (recall that 
$N$ does not refer to $x$):
\begin{align*}
  &\pllet{x}{M}{\Big( \pllet{y}{N}{\plpair{x}{y}} \Big)}\\
  &\stackrel{?}{=}\\
  &\pllet{y}{N}{\Big( \pllet{x}{M}{\plpair{x}{y}} \Big)}
\end{align*}

Intuitively, it seems like this ought to be a semantics-preserving rewrite for a
very similar reason to the fact that an identical rewrite is true for
\ref{lang:calc}. But, \ref{lang:tinyppl} does not have an identical denotation,
and so it seems like it requires a from-scratch proof to establish that 
this rewriting is sound.

Clearly this reordering is a general phenomenon we would like to study across 
many languages with different semantic interpretations.  Category theory gives
us a name for property of a semantic domain: it is called 
\textbf{commutativity}.  Moreover, category theory gives us language for
describing properties of a wide array of effects: probability is an example of a
\textbf{monad}, and this monad is commutative and hence such rewritings are
valid for \emph{all commutative monads}.\footnote{This commutativity property
was studied first by \citep{staton2017commutative}; it follows essentially the
order of summation can be interchanged. In the continuous case, this fact is
true by Fubini's theorem.}

\section{Generalization 2: Higher-order functions}
Functional languages have more than let-bindings and pairs. For instance, 
OCaml has higher-order functions, sum-types, and pattern-matching. These 
features can be difficult to specify, and category theory gives us a canonical 
way of designing these specifications.\footnote{Mention the categorical abstract machine}

We will illustrate this principle by higher-order functions:

\begin{gather}
  \begin{aligned}
   A,B &::= \plkw{Unit}
     \mid A \pltimes B
     \mid A \plto B
  \\
  M,N &::= \plunit{}
      \mid \plpair{M}{N}
      \mid \plfst{M}
      \mid \plsnd{M}
      \mid \pllam{x}{M}
      \mid \plapp{M}{N}
      \mid x
  \end{aligned}
  \label{lang:stlc}
  \tag{\textsc{stlc}}
\end{gather}

The \textbf{function type} $A \plkw{\to} B$ denotes functions from $A$ 
to $B$. Functions are introduced using lambda abstraction rule $\pllam{x}{M}$, defines a function 
with free variable $x$. Functions are eliminated with the lambda 
application rule $\plapp{M}{N}$, which calls the function $M$ with argument $N$.

Following our original setup with \ref{lang:calc}, we can give a denotational 
semantics to \ref{lang:stlc} by associating each type with a set and each 
term with a function between sets. For functions and function applications, this
looks like:
\begin{align*}
   \llbr{\pllam{x}{M}} &= \gamma \mapsto (v \mapsto \llbr{M}(\gamma[x \mapsto v])) \\
  \llbr{\plapp{M}{N}} &= \gamma \mapsto (\llbr{M}\gamma)(\llbr{N}\gamma) \\
\end{align*}

You should notice that it is not obvious that this interpretation is valid: 
it remains to be argued that $(v \mapsto \llbr{M}(\gamma[x \mapsto v]))$
is itself representable as an element of a set. 
This is true because it is possible to represent the set of all functions 
between two sets as a set: a function can be represented as its \emph{graph} (i.e., 
a set of input-output pairs), which is itself a set.

Again, following our previous development from \ref{lang:calc} to \ref{lang:tinyppl},
we wonder: is it similarly possible to represent first-class functions in 
the denotation of a probabilistic programming language? It's not at all obvious, 
at first, what shape a first-class function in a probabilistic programming 
language should have and whether it's possible to represent such an object.
In discrete probability it is possible to represent first-class functions, 
but in continuous probability it is not at all so straightforward: this was the 
problem being studied by \citep{heunen2017convenient}.

The crucial idea is that category theory will give us a general characterization 
of what it means for a semantic domain to support a first-class function: 
these will be called \emph{exponential objects}, and categories that have 
exponential objects are called \emph{Cartesian closed}
and are capable of giving denotations to simply-typed lambda calculi.

% \section{Generalization 3: Proof Irrelevance}
% Behavioral equivalence is slippery because there are many 
% valid notions of observer.
% % When reasoning about programs, it is often useful to reach for more exotic
% % interpretations than these. A well-known example is \emph{abstract
% % interpretation}~\citep{cousot1979systematic}, where programs can be analyzed by
% % interpreting them in an ``abstract domain''.
% %% For instance, suppose our abstract

% %% We can interpret \ref{lang:razor} programs as manipulating these predicates:

% \begin{align*}
%   \llbr{\plUnit} &= \top \\
%   \llbr{\plVoid} &= \bot \\
%   \llbr{A \pltimes B} &= \llbr{A} \land \llbr{B} \\
%   \llbr{A \plplus B} &= \llbr{A} \lor \llbr{B} \\
%   \llbr{A \plto B} &= \llbr{A} \Rightarrow \llbr{B}

%     \varnothing, &\text{if }\llbr{\Gamma} \not\vDash \llbr{A}
%   \end{cases}
% \end{align*}

% \begin{proposition}
%   If \(\Gamma \vdash M : A\)
%   then \(\mathsf{Ent}(\Gamma, A) = \{\star\}\).
% \end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}
%   By induction on \(\Gamma \vdash M : A\).

% \begin{align*}
%   \llbr{\Gamma \vdash M : A} &\in \mathsf{Ent}(\Gamma,A) \\
%   \llbr{M} &= \star
% \end{align*}

%% The symbol $\uplus$ denotes \emph{disjoint union of sets}. So, the
%% interpretation of $\dbracket{\texttt{3}}$ would be a set containing three stars
%% in it; and, then, addition simply combines these two sets. This is a sort of
%% unary representation.

% \section{A Final Encounter: Type Theory}

% Indeed, the more you study programming languages, the more you realize that
% there is great utility in having flexibility in how various programs are
% interpreted: the same syntax, when interpreted in a different light, can
% be given many useful and different meanings.

% A final example comes from type theory. Type theorists are often concerned with \emph{canonicity},
% which states that all well typed terms have a recognizable form.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item In the standard set-theoretic semantics,
%   types denote sets: \(\llbr{\plUnit}\) is the singleton set.
% \item In the truth value semantics,
%   types denote logical formulas: \(\llbr{\plUnit}\) is the formula \(\top\).
% \item In the ``canonicity'' semantics,
%   types denote sets of well-behaved syntactic terms:
%   \(\llbr{\plUnit}\) denotes those closed terms of type \(\plUnit\) that are
%   equationally equal to \(\star\).
% \end{itemize}

% \begin{align*}

\section{Conclusion}

This invites a question: \emph{what sort of structure must a mathematical object
have in order to be used to interpret a programming language}?
Among many other things, category theory gives us very satisfying answers to this question:
we will see that certain kinds of mathematical structure admit
properties like ``higher order functions'', a meaning of ``natural numbers'',
 ``logical truth,'' and the ``existence of fixpoints''. Category theory gives us a formal language for describing what kind of
structure a mathematical setting has. But before we get there, we'll see
more examples of interpreting programs.

% \section{Some notes on category theory resources}

% There are many excellent resources on category theory that all cover different
% aspects of the subject. We will briefly note some here that may be useful:

\chapter{Whence Categories}

We saw last time how many programming languages can be given denotational
interpretations in terms of sets and functions.
In all cases the underlying recipe was the same:
types \(A\) denote sets \(\llbr{A}\),
typing contexts \(x\ofty A,\dots\) denote Cartesian products \(\llbr{A} \times \dots\),
and terms \(\Gamma \vdash M : A\)
denote functions \(\llbr\Gamma \xrightarrow{\llbr{M}} \llbr{A}\).
In this way set theory serves as a ``metalanguage'' for giving mathematical meaning to programs.

As a metalanguage, sets and functions work best as a model of \emph{purely functional} programming,
where a program is thought of as a black box that produces a uniquely determined output value
for each input.
But real programs are rarely purely functional:
programs in the wild regularly manipulate resources (pointers, files, locks),
interact with their environment (input and output),
and use complex control flow constructs (exceptions, coroutines).

Category theory provides a framework for \emph{swapping out the ambient metalanguage}:
it provides techniques for systematically
replacing sets and functions with constructs that are more naturally equipped to model
realistic programming features.
Each category embodies a choice of metalanguage.
Sets and functions live in a \emph{category of sets} \(\Set\),
which we will encounter later on.
By swapping out \(\Set\) with other categories,
we gain access to other metalanguages that are better adapted to modelling programming language features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Traditional domain theory, of untyped lambda calculus and recursive
  functional programming such as Haskell, lives in a \emph{category of domains}.
  As a metalanguage, it supports arbitrary recursive definitions,
  and recursive types.
\item
  A lot of modern semantics takes place in
  a category of \emph{step-indexed sets}
  which as a metalanguage supports \emph{very} recursive types.
  We will meet this category later, when we discuss presheaves.
\item Programs that manipulate resources
  live in categories of \emph{resourceful sets},
  which are used to define modern separation logics.
  We will meet these categories when we discuss the Day convolution.
\item Probabilistic semantics live in a \emph{category of measurable spaces}.
  As a metalanguage, it supports getting the probability of events.
  Higher-order probability lives in \emph{quasi-Borel spaces}.
  We may get to these categories if time permits.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The concept of ``category'' abstracts over all of these examples.
Let's take a look at how categories formalize this situation.
First, a category is defined on a set of \textbf{objects}:
these are the ``types'' of the metalanguage it embodies.
Objects are related to each other by \textbf{morphisms}
\(A \xrightarrow{f} B\), or sometimes just \(f\) for short.
Each morphism \(A \xrightarrow{f} B\) is associated to a
\textbf{domain} \(A\) and a \textbf{codomain} \(B\).
Here is a \textbf{picture of a category}\footnote{A \emph{picture of a category}
shows objects as dots and morphisms as arrows, typically drawn with a box.} with some objects and morphisms in it:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{fig/simple-cat1.png}
\end{center}
Morphisms can be combined via \emph{composition},
which pastes together morphisms that are incident to each other to form new ones.
Composing $g$ after $f$ is denoted $g \circ f$, or sometimes more tersely as \(gf\).
The ordering is a bit confusing; I like to read $\circ$ as ``after''.
Pictorially, we can paste together edges $f$ and $g$ to get an edge $h$:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{fig/simple-cat2.png}
\end{center}
Categories satisfy several requirements that force them to behave nicely:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Every object has a self-loop called the \textbf{identity morphism},
  for an object $A$, we will denote its identity morphism as $\sf{id}_A$.
  This morphism must behave like an identity: for any morphism $A \xrightarrow{f} B$,
  it must be the case that $\sf{id}_B \circ f = f = f \circ \sf{id}_A$.
  \item Composition is \textbf{associative}, meaning that for any three morphisms
  $A \xrightarrow{f} B$, $B \xrightarrow{g} C$, $C \xrightarrow{h} D$,
  it is the case that $(f \circ g) \circ h = f \circ (g \circ h)$.
\end{itemize}
Summing up,\footnote{This definition of a category is one of many possible definitions. 
You may have seen different ones. This definition is used by \citep{crole1993categories}; 
different ones are used by \citep{mac1998categories}.}
\begin{definition}[Category]
  \label{def:category}
  \sloppy
  A category is a tuple \((O,M,\mathsf{dom},\mathsf{cod},\mathsf{id},\mathsf{comp})\)
  where
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item $O$ is a set whose elements are called ``objects''
  \item $M$ is a set whose elements are called ``morphisms''
  \item $\mathsf{dom} : M\to O$
  \item $\mathsf{cod} : M \to O$
  \item $\mathsf{id} : O\to M$
  \item $\mathsf{comp} : \{(f,g) \in M \times M \mid \mathsf{dom}(f) = \mathsf{cod}(g)\} \to M$
  \end{itemize}
  such that
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item For all \(f\) and \(g\) in \(M\) such that \(\mathsf{dom}(f) = \mathsf{cod}(g)\)
    it holds that
    \[
    \mathsf{dom}(\mathsf{comp}(f,g)) = \mathsf{dom}(g)
    \quad\text{and}\quad
    \mathsf{cod}(\mathsf{comp}(f,g)) = \mathsf{cod}(f)
    \]
  \item For all \(X\) in \(O\) it holds that \(\mathsf{dom}(\mathsf{id}_X) = \mathsf{cod}(\mathsf{id}_X) = X\)
  \item For all $f,g,h$ in $M$ such that
  $\mathsf{dom}(f) = \mathsf{cod}(g)$ and\\
  $\mathsf{dom}(g) = \mathsf{cod}(h)$, it holds that
  $$\mathsf{comp}(f,\mathsf{comp}(g,h)) = \mathsf{comp}(\mathsf{comp}(f,g),h)$$
  \item For all $f$ in $M$ it holds that $$\mathsf{comp}(f,\mathsf{id}_{\mathsf{dom}(f)})=f=\mathsf{comp}(\mathsf{id}_{\mathsf{cod}(f)}, f)$$
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\section{Our first metalanguage}

With a precise definition of category in hand, we are now ready to meet our first
``metalanguage''.

\marginnote{Set theorists may raise an eyebrow at
      the phrase ``set of finite sets'' in this definition.
      Strictly speaking, the set of finite sets does not form a set.
      But it is not that big of a deal:
      many workarounds are available.
      For instance, one could consider just finite subsets of \(\N\),
      or the set of \emph{hereditarily finite sets}
      (defined to be the union \(\bigcup_{n\in\N} \wp^n(\varnothing)\)).
      }
\begin{definition}[the category \(\FinSet\) of finite sets]
  \sloppy
  Let \(\FinSet\) be the category \((O,M,\dom,\cod,\circ,\idt)\)
  where \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
  \item \(O\) is the set of finite
    sets.
  \item \(M\) is the set of tuples \((A,f,B)\) where \(A\) and \(B\)
    are finite sets
    and \(f\) is a function from \(A\) to \(B\).
  \item \(\dom\) is the function \(\dom(A,f,B) = A\).
  \item \(\cod\) is the function \(\dom(A,f,B) = B\).
  \item \(\circ\) is the function \((B,f,C)\circ(A,g,B) = (A,f\circ g,C)\)
    where \(f\circ g\) is the ordinary function composition of \(f\) and \(g\),
    well defined because the domain of \(f\) matches the codomain of \(g\).
  \item \(\idt_A\) is \((A,i,A)\) where \(i\) is the identity function on \(A\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The category laws are satisfied because function composition is associative
  and composing a function with the identity function does nothing.

Mathematically, \(\FinSet\) provides a categorical home for finite set theory.
As a metalanguage, \(\FinSet\) embodies \emph{finite purely functional programming}.
For instance,
the following is a picture of the negation function \(f : \{T,F\} \to \{T,F\}\) 
in the category \(\FinSet\):

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    % Define the node
    \node[circle, draw] (A) at (0,0) {$\{T,F\}$};
    
    % Draw self loop
    \draw[->, thick] (A) to[loop above] node[above] {$f$} (A);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The above picture tells is that there \emph{is} a morphism called $f$, 
but it does not tell us anything about the \emph{content} of $f$. In particular, 
it is useful to know how $f$ maps elements of its domain to its codomain. 
To see this, we can draw the \textbf{internal picture} of this category
that visualizes the computational content of its morphisms:\footnote{Not 
all categories will have nice internal pictures, and different kinds of category 
will have their own visual language for describing their morphisms.}

\begin{center}
 \begin{tikzpicture}
  % First circle with T and F dots
  \draw[thick] (0,0) circle (1);
  \node at (-0.3,0.3) {$\bullet$};
  \node at (-0.3,0.6) {$T$};
  \node at (0.3,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
  \node at (0.3,-0.6) {$F$};
  
  % Second circle with T and F dots
  \draw[thick] (4,0) circle (1);
  \node (T2) at (3.7,0.3) {$\bullet$};
  \node at (3.7,0.6) {$T$};
  \node (F2) at (4.3,-0.3) {$\bullet$};
  \node at (4.3,-0.6) {$F$};
  
    % Arrow from T on the left to F on the right
    \draw[->, thick] (-0.3,0.3) -- (4.3,-0.3);
    
    % Arrow from F on the left to T on the right
    \draw[->, thick] (0.3,-0.3) -- (3.7,0.3) node[midway, below] {$f$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Do not confuse the internal picture of a category with its picture: the internal 
picture ``peers inside objects'', and will not generalize to all kinds of categories.
This internal picture visualizes how the map $f$ behaves. A crucial 
piece information that this internal picture conveys is when two morphisms 
in \(\FinSet\) are equal: it is when they are \emph{extensionally equal}.

\todo: internal picture of \(\mathsf{not} \circ \mathsf{not} = \mathsf{id}\)


\section{Gaining intuition for categories}

The definition of category is highly abstract---and necessarily so, in order to be general enough
to accommodate all of the metalanguages just mentioned.
Next time, we will see how this level of abstraction allows for
clean axiomatizations of the various kinds of ``features'' that a metalanguage may support,
in the form of so-called ``universal constructions.''
This is what gives category theory its unifying power.

As preparation, we will first need to become quite comfortable working
with categories in the abstract. To do this, it is key to
have in mind a few representative examples of categories
to draw intuition from.

\subsection{Categories as graphs}

The first perspective on categories, which is perhaps most
comfortable to computer scientists, is that they are ``directed multigraphs with extra structure.''
Objects are vertices and morphisms are edges.
On top of this basic graph structure, categories come with a
composition operation that pastes two incident edges together to form a third,
and identity morphisms \(\mathsf{id}_A\) that form self-loops centered at each vertex \(A\).
The category laws then say that pasting of edges is an associative operation,
and that pasting with an identity morphism does nothing.
This provides nice visual intuition, and a large stock of example categories.
In fact,
\begin{construction}
  Every directed multigraph can be turned into a category.
\end{construction}
\begin{proof}
  Let \(G\) be a directed multigraph,
  encoded as a tuple \((V,E,\mathsf{src},\mathsf{trg})\)
  where \(V\) is the set of vertices, \(E\) is the set of edges,
  and \(\mathsf{src},\mathsf{trg}\) are functions \(E\to V\)
  that send each edge to its source and target vertices respectively.
  The graph \(G\) can be used to define a category
  \[
  \mathsf{paths}(G) = (O,M,\dom,\cod,\circ,\idt)
  \]
  where
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \(O = V\)
  \item \(M\) is the set of paths in \(G\),
    which are tuples \((v_s,[e_1,\dots,e_n],v_t)\)
    where \(v_s,v_t\) are vertices and \(e_1,\dots,e_n\) is a list of edges satisfying
    \(\mathsf{src}(e_1) = v_s\) and \(\mathsf{trg}(e_n) = v_t\)
    and \(\mathsf{trg}(e_i) = \mathsf{src}(e_{i+1})\)
    for all \(1\le i < n\).
  \item \(\dom : M \to O\) is the function \(\dom(v_s,[e_1,\dots,e_n],v_t) = v_s\)
  \item \(\cod : M \to O\) is the function \(\cod(v_s,[e_1,\dots,e_n],v_t) = v_t\)
  \item \(\circ\) concatenates paths:
    \((v_t,[f_1,\dots,f_n],v_u)\circ(v_s,[e_1,\dots,e_m],v_t) = (v_s,[e_1,\dots,e_m,f_1,\dots,f_n],v_u)\).
    Note that this is well-defined because the two paths \(\vec f\) and \(\vec e\) line up tip-to-tail.
    Note also that \(\vec e\) comes before \(\vec f\) in the concatenated path, due to the reversal of order
    of arguments to \(\circ\).
  \item \(\idt_v\) is the empty path \((v,[],v)\) starting and ending at \(v\).
  \end{itemize}
  The category laws are satisfied because concatenation of paths is associative and concatenating a path with the
  empty path does nothing.
\end{proof}
\begin{note}
  It is essential that morphisms are \emph{paths} in this construction, and not edges!
  Otherwise, it would be unclear how to define composition and identity.
\end{note}

\subsection{A Difference Between Categories and Directed Multigraphs}

A key difference between categories and graphs is that
two morphisms in a category that come from
different ``paths'' may nonetheless be equal.
For example, the following two ``paths'' through \(\FinSet\)
are actually the same, because negating a Boolean twice is the same as doing nothing:
\[% https://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/#N4Igdg9gJgpgziAXAbVABwnAlgFyxMJZABgBpiBdUkANwEMAbAVxiRAB13gAVUgMU4BfEINLpMufIRQAmclVqMWbTj35CRYkBmx4CRAIykDC+s1aIOXXgPbDBCmFADm8IqABmAJwgBbJGQgOBBIRormKuy+dDgAFnAewJA49lrefqHUwUhy4cqWnNFxCUkQKZqePv6IgdmIuWb5VlhQOAD6wKo2QsLUDHQARjAMAAoSetIgXljOsTgiFIJAA
\begin{tikzcd}
{\{T,F\}} \arrow[rr, "\mathsf{not}"] \arrow[rd, "{\idt_{\{T,F\}}}"'] &           & {\{T,F\}} \arrow[ld, "\mathsf{not}"] \\
                                                                     & {\{T,F\}} &
\end{tikzcd}\]
This relationship between the paths \(\mathsf{not}\circ \mathsf{not}\) and \(\idt_{\{T,F\}}\)
is often conveyed by saying that the triangle above is ``filled in'', or ``commutes''.
The intuition being that one can then ``continuously deform''
\(\mathsf{not}\circ\mathsf{not}\) into \(\idt_{\{T,F\}}\),
by ``dragging'' it through the filled in triangle.

This idea is a handy visual tool for organizing categorical information
and for conducting proofs.

\subsection{Categories as orders}

A special case of a multigraph is a graph, where there is \emph{at most one} arrow between any given pair of vertices.
This leads us to the second class of important examples of a category:
\begin{definition}[preorder]
  \sloppy
  A preorder is a pair \((X,\preceq)\)
  where \(X\) is a set and \(\preceq\)
  is a binary relation on \(X\)
  that is reflexive (\(x\preceq x\) for all \(x\) in \(X\))
  and transitive (if \(x \preceq y\) and \(y\preceq z\) then \(x \preceq z\)).
\end{definition}
Preorders are often fruitfully drawn as \emph{Hasse diagrams}.
%% An object is like an element of a preorder
%% and a morphism \(x\to y\) is like a ``proof'' that \(x\le y\).
A simple example is the set \(\N\) of natural numbers,
ordered by \(m\preceq n\) if \(m\) is less than or equal to \(n\).
We can draw this preorder as follows:
\[
% https://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/#N4Igdg9gJgpgziAXAbVABwnAlgFyxMJZABgBoBmAXVJADcBDAGwFcYkRiQBfU9TXfIRRkATNTpNW7AIzdeIDNjwEiZaeIYs2iECLl8lg1aWIbJ2kAB1LtKBBwIu4mFADm8IqABmAJwgBbJHIaHAgkERoACxh6KHZIMDYebz9AxAiQUKRpKJi4nQSk+V8A7JCwxDIQaNj4giTKLiA
\begin{tikzcd}
\vdots \arrow[d, no head] \\
2 \arrow[d, no head]      \\
1 \arrow[d, no head]      \\
0
\end{tikzcd}\]
Hasse diagrams are read bottom-up, with the least elements 
on the bottom and the greatest elements on the top. 
An undirected edge is drawn between elements with no elements 
between them (this is why we have no edge from 0 to 2 in the above figure).
A more visually interesting preorder on \(\N\)
is to define \(m \preceq n\) if \(m\) is a \emph{divisor} of \(n\).
This preorder looks less like a straight line and more like a lattice:
\[
% https://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/#N4Igdg9gJgpgziAXAbVABwnAlgFyxMJZARgBoBmAXVJADcBDAGwFcYkRiQBfU9TXfIRQAGUgCZqdJq3ZjuvEBmx4CRMhJoMWbRCHLy+ywUTHjJWmboCsBxfxVDko4uek6QANltKBqlGRdNN3ZiYW97YxRTQKltEJseQ19HUWFXON0AHUzaKAgcBES7Iz9kUzSgjJBs3PzChR8HNVIK2MtqnLyC7kkYKABzeCJQADMAJwgAWyQyEBwIJFEQAAsYeih2SDA2IvGppFM5hcQl1fXNgh2FPenEchp5xZozjd0tq9GJ248H48OXi7bWw3JA-I5Ie4rNavcCXYFfJBWX4zZ7QwEfEAgxBI8F3VHnN5w3YIxAAFmRiH+aMJQOJ+zJFNmAJpGKx5NxAHZ8TD3vD6WDHogABzc9F8244wUATlFLJ6XCAA

2 \arrow[rd, no head]                                       & 3 \arrow[d, no head]                                          & 5 \arrow[ld, no head]                                        \\
                                                            & 1                                                             &
\end{tikzcd}
\]
Preorders don't have to be discrete either: the real numbers \(\R\),
for instance, form a preorder with \(x \preceq y\) if \(x\) is less than or equal to \(y\). This is a little harder to draw.

A preorder that arises frequently in PL is the preorder of
\emph{run-time environments}.
It is common to model these environments
as partial functions \(\rho : \mathsf{Var} \rightharpoonup \mathsf{Val}\),
assigning to each program variable \(x \in \mathsf{Var}\)
a concrete value \(\rho(x)\).
These substitutions form a preorder, with \(\rho \preceq \rho'\)
if \(\rho\) is a subset of \(\rho'\), in the sense that all the 
variables in $\rho$ are in $\rho'$ and mapped to the same values.
%% \item Heaps under disjoint union: let \(\mathsf{Heap}\) be the category
%%   whose objects are substitutions \(\gamma\),
%%   i.e., partial functions \(\mathsf{Loc} \rightharpoonup \Z\),
%%   and whose morphisms from \(h\) to \(h'\)
%%   are heaps \(h_{\mathsf{diff}}\) such that \(h \uplus h_{\mathsf{diff}} = h\).

Preorders forms a category:
\begin{construction} \label{prop:every-preorder-is-a-category}
  Every preorder can be turned into a category.
  \label{eq:const-preorder}
\end{construction}
\begin{proof}
  For any preorder \((X,\preceq)\), there is a category
  \[
    \mathsf{order}(X,\preceq) = (O,M,\dom,\cod,\circ,\idt)
  \]
  where
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \(O = X\).
    \item \(M = (\preceq)\) (recall that a binary relation like \(\preceq\)
      can be thought of as a set of pairs, with \((x,y) \in (\preceq)\)
      if and only if \(x\preceq y\)).
    \item \(\dom\) is the function \(\dom(x,y) = x\).
    \item \(\cod\) is the function \(\cod(x,y) = y\).
    \item \(\circ\) is the function defined by \((y,z)\circ(x,y) = (x,z)\).
      Note that we may assume that the two arguments to \(\circ\)
      share a component \(y\) in this definition because of the assumption
      that \((y,z)\) and \((x,y)\) are composable.
      Note also that the composite \((x,z)\) is indeed well-defined
      this is well defined by the transitivity of \(\preceq\).
    \item \(\idt_x\) is the pair \((x,x)\), which forms a valid morphpism
      by reflexivity of \(\preceq\).
  \end{itemize}
  The category laws are satisfied automatically,
  as there can only be at most one morphism between any two objects.\footnote{Pause: 
  why is this the case?}
\end{proof}
\noindent
The intuitive import of Proposition~\ref{prop:every-preorder-is-a-category}
is that every category can be thought of as a kind of preorder,\footnote{\emph{Reminder}: not all 
categories directly correspond to some preorder construction, since there can be multiple 
morphisms between objects in a general category. A category with at most 1 morphism between 
any 2 objects is called a \emph{thin category}, and it does correspond to some preorder.}
where the existence of a morphism \(A\xrightarrow{f} B\)
expresses that \(A\) is in some sense ``less than or equal to'' \(B\).
Thinking of categories in this way leads to interesting questions like:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Does a category have a ``smallest'' or ``largest'' object?
  For instance, the smallest runtime environment is the empty environment $\emptyset$
  with no variables in it.
\item Does a category have ``ascending sequences''?
  For example, 
  \begin{align}
   \emptyset \subseteq \{x\mapsto A\} \subseteq \{x\mapsto A, y\mapsto B\} \subseteq \dots 
   \label{eq:env-seq}
  \end{align}
  is an ascending sequence in the preorder of runtime environments.
\item  Does a category have ``limit'' objects, like suprema or infima?  For
  instance, you probably know from calculus that there limits in \(\R\): for
  example, the sequence $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8},
  \frac{1}{16}\cdots$ approaches 0 in the limit.  A very interesting question is:
  which categories ``have limits'', in the sense that such sequences always
  converge to some object in the category?

  An example of a situation where there is no limit is the sequence in
  \cref{eq:env-seq}.  The set of environments grows and grows, and since there
  is no notion of a ``greatest environment'', there is no limit to this
  sequence.
\item
  Given two categories, is there a notion of ``monotone map'' between them?
\end{itemize}

Each of the above observations is foreshadowing a notion of a ``universal construction''
in a category, which we will explore in the following lectures.

\subsection{Categories as algebras}

Whereas preorders are like multigraphs where there is at most one \emph{edge}
between any two vertices,
the opposite extreme is a multigraph with exactly one \emph{vertex},
so that all edges are self-loops:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\begin{tikzcd}
	\star
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-1, loop, in=55, out=125, distance=10mm]
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-1, loop, in=60, out=120, distance=5mm]
	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-1, loop, in=50, out=130, distance=15mm]
\end{tikzcd}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Categories of this shape form our final class of important example:
a special kind of algebraic structure called a \emph{monoid}.
\begin{definition}[monoid]
  A monoid is a tuple \((X,\bullet,e)\)
  where \(\bullet\) is a binary operation on \(X\)
  (a function \(X \times X \to X\))
  that is associative (\(x\bullet (y\bullet z) = (x\bullet y) \bullet z\))
  and has \(e\) as a unit (\(x\bullet e = x\) and \(e\bullet x = x\)).
\end{definition}
A simple example of a monoid is \((\N,+,0)\),
the monoid of natural numbers under addition.
This forms a monoid because addition of natural numbers is associative
and has zero as a unit.

An example that is closer to PL
comes from the semantics of imperative programs.
It is common to interpret an imperative program
as a function \(S \to S\), where \(S\) is a set of
memory states.
For example, the program
\[
  x := x + 1;
\]
can be interpreted
as a function that sends a memory state \(s\)
to a new memory state \(s'\) in which
the value of \(x\) has been incremented by \(1\).
The functions \(S \to S\) form a monoid
\((S\to S,\bullet,\mathsf{id})\),
where the monoid operation is given by \(f \bullet g = g \circ f\)
(note the reversal!),
corresponding to the sequencing of the programs \(f\) and \(g\),
and the identity element is the identity function on \(S\),
corresponding to the empty program that does nothing.

Algebraic identities capture program rewrites for this imperative language.
For example, if \(f\) is the interpretation of \(x := 0\)
and \(g\) is the interpretation of \(y := 1\),
and \(x\) and \(y\) are distinct program variables,
then the program equation
\begin{equation}
  \left(\begin{aligned}
    &x := 0 \\
    &y := 1
  \end{aligned}\right)
  \equiv
  \left(\begin{aligned}
    &y := 1 \\
    &x := 0
  \end{aligned}\right)
\end{equation}
can be expressed as the algebraic identity \(g \circ f = f \circ g\).

\begin{construction} \label{prop:every-monoid-is-a-category}
  Every monoid can be turned into a category.
\end{construction}
\begin{proof}
  For any monoid \((X,\bullet,e)\) there is a category
  \[
    \mathsf{mon}(X,\bullet,e) = (O,M,\dom,\cod,\circ,\idt)
  \]
  where
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \(O = \{\star\}\), a singleton set with a single dedicated element \(\star\).
    \marginnote{Technically set theory does not contain stars in it.
    But this is no matter.
    The symbol \(\star\) can be interpreted as any object of
    your choice---all that matters
    is that \(O\) is a singleton set.
    For instance, one could set \(\star =
    \varnothing\).
    }
  \item \(M = X\)
  \item \(\dom(M) = \star\)
  \item \(\cod(M) = \star\)
  \item Composition is defined by \(x \circ y = x \bullet y\)
  \item \(\idt_\star = e\)
  \end{itemize}
  The category laws follow from the associativity of \((\bullet)\)
  and that it has \(e\) as a unit.
\end{proof}
\begin{note}
  It is very important that the set of objects \(O\) is a singleton set \(\{\star\}\).
  A natural thought one might have is that the set of objects should be the set \(X\) of elements of the monoid.
  But this in fact does not work: what would be the morphisms?

  There is actually a good reason why the set of objects is the seemingly-arbitrary singleton set \(\{\star\}\) in this construction.
  It comes from the fact that a monoid is what is called a \emph{single-sorted} algebraic structure; hence \(\{\star\}\)
  is a set with a single element.
\end{note}
The intuitive import of
Proposition~\ref{prop:every-monoid-is-a-category} is that
every category can be thought of as a kind of algebraic structure,
where composition is like ``multiplication''
and identity morphisms are like ``multiplicative units''.

The algebraic perspective leads to questions like:
given an equation between morphisms containing some unknowns,
are there zero, one, or infinitely many solutions?
When can I ``cancel'' a morphism from both sides of an equation (e.g., from \(fg = fh\) deduce \(g=h\),
or from \(fh = gh\) deduce \(f=g\))?
When does a morphism have an ``inverse''?
When can a morphism \(f\) be ``factored'' into two pieces, \(f = gh\)?


\section{Putting intuitions to the test}

We conclude this section by illustrating each of the three perspectives
on categories on the following
\textbf{categorification}\footnote{The idea of ``categorification'' is to 
cast a notion one is familiar with -- like ``subset inclusion'' into 
the language of objects and morphisms. This is a very important idea 
in category theory because it allows one to take familiar concepts 
and apply them to unfamiliar categories.} of
a basic concept from set theory: subset inclusion.
\begin{proposition} \label{prop:subset-leq-iff-triangle}
Suppose \(U\) and \(V\) are subsets of a finite set \(X\).
Then \(U \subseteq V\) if and only if
there exists a dashed \(\FinSet\)-morphism \(f\)
such that \(v \circ f = u\),
where \(u\) and \(v\) are the \(\FinSet\)-morphisms
corresponding to the inclusion functions\footnote{A function $f : X \to Y$ 
is an \emph{inclusion function} (also called an ``injective map'') if 
each element of $X$ is mapped to a unique element in $Y$. 
All inclusion functions have a ``left inverse'': 
there exists a function $g$ such that $g \circ f = \mathsf{id}_X$.
Inclusion maps are rendered using tailed arrows.} \(U \to X\) and \(V \to X\)
respectively:

                                                 & X &
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}
You will prove Proposition~\ref{prop:subset-leq-iff-triangle} in the homework.
As preparation,
let's appreciate what it is saying: a basic set theoretic
property \(U\subseteq V\) about finite subsets
can be recast in terms of a purely category-theoretic property
about \(\FinSet\).
This categorification takes roughly two steps.
The first step is to express the subsets \(U\) and \(V\)
as morphisms \(u\) and \(v\).
The second step is to express \(U\subseteq V\)
as a property of the morphisms \(u\) and \(v\).
Let's try to get some intuition for what this property is saying
from each of the perspectives we've developed so far.
\begin{itemize}
\item Graphically, it says that the morphisms \(u\) and \(v\)
  fit into a triangle with \(f\) that is ``filled in''.
\item Order-theoretically, it says that the morphism \(u\) is somehow
  ``less than or equal to'' \(v\), by virtue of there being a dashed morphism
  \(f\) witnessing this order relationship.

  We can make this formal as follows.
  For any finite set \(X\), one can construct a category \(\mathsf{Sub}(X)\).
  The objects of this category are tuples \((U,u)\) where \(U\) is a subset of \(X\)
  and \(u\) is the function \(U \to X\) defined by \(u(x) = x\);
  i.e., \(u\) is the canonical inclusion function of \(U\) into \(X\).
  The morphisms of this category are, roughly speaking,
  pictures of the following shape:
  \[
  % https://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/#N4Igdg9gJgpgziAXAbVABwnAlgFyxMJZABgBpiBdUkANwEMAbAVxiRAFUQBfU9TXfIRQBGUsKq1GLNgA1uvEBmx4CRAEzkJ9Zq0QgAatwkwoAc3hFQAMwBOEALZIyIHBCSjJOtkxDUGdACMYBgAFfhUhEBssUwALHHlrO0dEDRc3RA9taT0aRJBbBydqVyQ07N0Coy4gA
\begin{tikzcd}
U \arrow[rd, "u"'] \arrow[rr, "f"] &   & V \arrow[ld, "v"] \\
                                   & X &
\end{tikzcd}
  \]
  Formally, a morphism is a tuple \((U,u,f,V,v)\)
  where \(U\) and \(V\) are subsets of \(X\),
  \(u : U \to X\) and \(v : V \to X\) are the canonical inclusions,
  and \(f\) is a function \(U \to V\)
  such that \(v \circ f = u\).
  Each morphism \((U,u,f,V,v)\) has domain \((U,u)\)
  and codomain \((V,v)\).

  Now Proposition~\ref{prop:subset-leq-iff-triangle}
  says that \(U\subseteq V\) if and only if there is a morphism from \((U,u)\)
  to \((V,v)\) in the category \(\mathsf{Sub}(X)\),
  witnessing the fact that \((U,u)\) is ``less than or equal to'' \((V,v)\).

\item Algebraically, it says that the equation \(u = v \circ f\)
  has a solution in the unknown \(f\).
\end{itemize}
Let's see each of these in action on the following proof.
\begin{proposition}
  If \(U\subseteq V\) and \(V \subseteq W\) then \(U\subseteq W\).
\end{proposition}
Each perspective lends itself to a different proof strategy.
\begin{itemize}
\item Graphically, you paste two filled in triangles to get a bigger filled in triangle.
\item Order-theoretically, you use the fact that \(\mathsf{Sub}(X)\), as a category,
  has composition.
\item Algebraically, you use that \(u = vf = wvg\) provides a solution to \(u = wh\).
\end{itemize}

%% \item Refinement corresponds to solvability of an equation that looks like a square.
%%   Suppose you have a subset \(U\) of a finite set \(X\),
%%   a subset \(V\) of a finite set \(Y\),
%%   and a function \(f : X \to Y\).
%%   Let \(u : U \rightarrowtail X\) and \(v : V \rightarrowtail Y\) be the relevant inclusions.

%%   Suppose \(f\) satisfies the property that,
%%   for all \(x \in U\), it holds that \(f(x) \in V\).
%%   This can be expressed as saying that the equation
%%   \(fu = vg\) is \emph{solvable} in the unknown \(g\).
%%   Diagramatically:
%%   \[
%%   % https://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/#N4Igdg9gJgpgziAXAbVABwnAlgFyxMJZABgBpiBdUkANwEMAbAVxiRAFUQBfU9TXfIRQBGclVqMWbAGrdeIDNjwEiZYePrNWiEAA05fJYKKj11TVJ0BNbuJhQA5vCKgAZgCcIAWyRkQOCCQAJmocOiwGNjCIkHNJbRAmWJAGOgAjGAYABX5lIRB3LAcACxwDEA9vJFF-QMQAZlDwyJ1oyLitNhpyyp9EPwDqjssQBx7PPpDapEaJTp1XZNSM7NzjHUKSsq4KLiA
%% \begin{tikzcd}
%% U \arrow[d, "u"', tail] \arrow[r, "g"] & V \arrow[d, "v", tail] \\
%% X \arrow[r, "f"']                      & Y
%% \end{tikzcd}
%%   \]
%%   This situation actually comes up quite a lot in PL,
%%   as we will see when we discuss logical relations.

%%   (By the way, the solution \(g\), if it exists, must be the \emph{only} solution to this equation,
%%   as if one finds \(g\) and \(g'\) such that \(fu = vg\) and \(fu = vg'\), then \(vg=fu=vg'\),
%%   and left-cancellativity of \(v\) implies \(g = g'\).)
