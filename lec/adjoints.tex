\chapter{Week 3: adjoints}

\begin{itemize}
\item We've seen three examples of ``inverses to product'':
  exponentiation in STLC, magic wand in separation logic,
  and lollipop in linear type theory.
  These are all instances of adjunctions.
\item Adjoints as a whole family of universal properties (recast univ. prop. of
  (co)products, pullbacks, (co)limits more generally in these terms)
\item Adjoints as approximate inverses (Galois connections in AI, comma category
  statement. Example: biorthogonal closure)
\item Right adjoints preserve limits, and left adjoints preserve colimits.
    This immediately shows \begin{itemize}
      \item In STLC, $\times$ distributes over $+$
      \item Separating conjunction distributes over disjunction
      \item Magic wand distributes over conjunction
    \end{itemize}
\item Adjoints are unique up to unique isomorphism. Application:
  calculate exponents of presheaves

\end{itemize}
