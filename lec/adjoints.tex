\chapter{Adjoints}



% \begin{itemize}
% \item We've seen three examples of ``inverses to product'':
%   exponentiation in STLC, magic wand in separation logic,
%   and lollipop in linear type theory.
%   These are all instances of adjunctions.
% \item Adjoints as a whole family of universal properties (recast univ. prop. of
%   (co)products, pullbacks, (co)limits more generally in these terms)
% \item Adjoints as approximate inverses (Galois connections in AI, comma category
%   statement. Example: biorthogonal closure)
% \item Right adjoints preserve limits, and left adjoints preserve colimits.
%     This immediately shows \begin{itemize}
%       \item In STLC, $\times$ distributes over $+$
%       \item Separating conjunction distributes over disjunction
%       \item Magic wand distributes over conjunction
%     \end{itemize}
% \item Adjoints are unique up to unique isomorphism. Application:
%   calculate exponents of presheaves
% \item Fun reference: \href{https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2025/02/universal_characterization_of.html#c063905}{Meas is not cartesian closed}
